You can follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv/tree/v3.4.1?tab=readme-ov-file#structure) to install opencv by yourself, or you can download the [compiled file](https://github.com/Zhang-CH0/mexopencv.git). (The Opencv3.4.1 with opencv_contrib-3.4.1 was built by cmake and compiled by visual studio 2015, so you do not compile anymore.)
